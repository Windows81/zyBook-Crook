Use at your own discretion.  Professors assign homework to engage student learning.  If you believe the material you are taking for a ZyBooks course is of value to you, do refrain from using my tool, as it completes the challenge activities as well as the ones for participation.  All relevant parameters are editable in `config.json`.

Frank Vahid, one of the co-founders of ZyBooks, reached out to me about this project.  There is a good chance the checksum function is no longer passable.  As of 2022-02-05, I have no intention to update this myself, though in the spirit of FOSS, you're welcome to make the changes yourself.  This is subject to change if I take another university course with a ZyBook I could go without.
